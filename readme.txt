Fuel Station simulation Project.

There are 4 Visual Studio projects for the 4 systems.
To test,
1. First run the PSS_Server
2. Run PSS_POS and connect with a POS ID
3. Run PSS_Pump
4. Run PSS_Manager

Notes:
# Pumps have a randomly generated ID.
# Server sends the daily report when the last POS terminal disconnected.
